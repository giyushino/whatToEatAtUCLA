# whatToEatAtUCLA

Welcome to What2Eat@UCLA! This repository is meant to help you choose what dining hall to eat at depending on your preferences. 

This project currently relies heavily on Deepseek, so you will need an API key. However, there are plans to have this project run on lightweight, open-source LLMs, as well as using cosine similarity (explained more at the end).

To set up this project, clone the project and create a new Anaconda environment

```sh
conda create -n <my-env>
pip install -r .
pip install -e .
```
