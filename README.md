# whatToEatAtUCLA

Welcome to What2Eat@UCLA! This repository is meant to help you choose what dining hall to eat at depending on your preferences. 

The major backbone of this project relies on Deepseek, so you will need an API key. However, there are plans to have this project run on lightweight, opensource LLMs, as well as using cosine similarity (explained more at end).

To use this project, run 

```sh
pip install -r .
pip install -e .
```
